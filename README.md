# SoundSanctuary
Webgl game using BabylonJs. We're in a post apocalyptic world as a lone survivor isolated inside of our home with no established contact to anyone else. Alone without music isn't a life anyone should have to endure and neither will our character. The goal is to find the required pieces to repair an old broken radio and add music and beauty back into our shattered world.

Alone without music isn't a life anyone should have to endure and neither will our character. The goal is to find the required pieces to repair an old broken radio and hopefully add music and beauty back into our shattered world, or at least hope someone else may be out there.
